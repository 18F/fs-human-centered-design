# Meetings and tools

## Project meetings

### Weekly check-in
We have a weekly check-in meeting with Aaron, Brian, Melissa, and Mark. (Oleysa from 18F is also invited.) The standing agenda for these meetings:
 - What happened last week
 - Plans for the coming week
 - Blockers

 (We also have separate periodic check ins and planning meetings with Forest Service staff involved in our various related projects.)

### Monthly retros
We have monthly retrospectives with the 18F and FS leads. Retros cover:
- What's working well
- What could be better
- What actions will we take to improve

 (We also have separate retros with Forest Service staff involved in our various related projects.)

## Tools

### Documents and tasks
We'll host project documents in a (Github repository)[https://github.com/18F/fs-human-centered-design] for this project. For visibility to the broader ePermits team, project tasks are tracked in the ePermits Trello (task board)[https://trello.com/b/ONDcGQnk/forest-service-e-permitting-project]. Tasks for this project are marked with a blue "nrm-hcd" label. 

Github is the one place that both Forest Service and GSA staff can access without much rigamarole.

### Chat in Slack 
We have two channels in the GSA TTS Slack for this project, #fs-hcd, and #fs-hcd-partners:
 - **#fs-hcd** is for 18F staff and FS leadership to discuss agreements and program-level questions.
 - **fs-hcd-partners** includes FS staff who are participating as cadre members.

## Other rituals

### "Weekly ship"
We prepare a weekly update on this project's progress that we email to Aaron and Brian each Friday.
