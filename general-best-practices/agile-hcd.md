# Agile + human-centered design

Agile, by itself, isn't human-centered. It's a methodology for building iteratively, not making sure we build the *right* thing iteratively. We combine some elements of human-centered design with agile to make sure our software works well.

## 1. Product owners prioritize stories based on research, not their gut.
- **Traditional agile practice:** POs use their own experience to decide what stories best meet business and user needs.
- **Our practice:** We believe product owners should make decisions based on synthesized research patterns seen across interviews, [usability tests](https://github.com/18F/fs-human-centered-design/blob/master/general-best-practices/usability-testing.md)). about the people who use the product. Although POs know a lot, we don't assume POs know everything about what everyone needs, or what needs hold true across different contexts.
- **How 18F supports POs:** We make sure the PO has understandable research to drive their decisions. Sometimes, we conduct the research. More often, we make sure our vendor teams' researcher is conducting the right research and presenting actionable results.

## 2. New stories come from research.
- **Traditional agile practice:** POs write new stories based on their expertise or what they hear from others (anecdotally).
- **Our practice:** We believe new stories should largely come from research: either ongoing usability testing, systematic interviews or other design research methods. (Sometimes new stories come from urgent agency needs or other extraordinary circumstances.) We believe new stories should come from research so the team focuses on features that serve the largest number of people.
- **How 18F supports POs:** We make sure product owners have a continuous stream of research results and new story suggestions. We also coach product owners on using research to validate their ideas  before adding them to the backlog.

## 3. Before stories are complete, they're [usability tested](https://github.com/18F/fs-human-centered-design/blob/master/general-best-practices/usability-testing.md)).
- **Traditional agile practice:** Stories are marked completed after review by the PO and, sometimes, "user acceptance testing."
- **Our practice:** We believe stories aren't complete until we see end-users (not experts or developers), using the piece of software developed to meet the story. We think usability testing each story helps us a) catch bugs that only exist in the user's environments, b) validate that we have met the users' need. We consider stories complete if users complete the task. We will write new stories for potential improvements when the usability testing suggests their may be an additional feature that will add additional value.
- **How 18F supports POs:** We make sure usability testing meets a set of minimum standards. We also coach vendors on how to conduct testing and report its results to the product owner.

## 4. We make controversial design decisions based on research.
If research isn't helpful, we revert to standard best practice. If neither is available, the product owner makes the ultimate decision.
- **Traditional agile practice:** The PO has the ultimate say over how stories are implemented. When there's disagreement or questions, they make design decisions.
- **Our practice:** a) If a design decision is controversial because of a disagreement amongst the team, or between the team and stakeholders, we conduct research to help arbitrate it. b) If research is inconclusive or impossible, we will implement the "industry best practice" or _how everyone else does it._ c) If there's no good research or best practice, it will be up to the product owner to decide.
- **How 18F supports POs:** Our design lead offers advice on small design issues, but escalates larger ones to the PO, usually with a suggested solution.
