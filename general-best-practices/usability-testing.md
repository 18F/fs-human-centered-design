# Usability testing

## What it is?
Asking users to complete tasks with your system while you observe what's easy and hard.

## Key elements
- **Multiple participants.** Multiple people, hopefully five or more, complete tasks.
- **Participants are representative.** Participants are people who actually use the application (or do the task the application is supposed to support).
- **Participants complete tasks.** We don't guide participants and ask questions. We give them a task and they try to complete it without help. We observe and ask a few follow up questions.
- **We look for patterns, not individual opinions.** We act on experiences shared across multiple users, not the particularly strong opinions of a few.

## What it isn't
- **Focus groups**. One user, not a group of people, participate at a time. We don't ask their opinion about what they see; we ask them to complete tasks and see their behaviors.
- **Informal conversations**. Usability tests are systematic: we ask each participant to do the same task, with the same wording.
- **A "demo"**. The purpose of a usability test isn't to show what the software can do; it's to watch users try to complete the demo. Showing users the software (while a product team member drives) isn't the same as usability testing.
