# NRM human-centered design jumpstart

## Overarching hypothesis

This project is in itself an experiment. We're testing the following idea:

We believe that *coaching and elevating agile, human-centered design champions
NRM staff* will result in *systems that better work for users.* We'll know we're right when *systems involved improve self-defined customer service metrics.*

## Principles

As we approach this project together, we value:

- Teaching others over just doing. This effort should build skills amongst Forest Service staff, not do the work for them.
- Targeting the “early adopters” over being everything to everyone. Instead of trying to teach everyone a little, let’s try to teach a few people a lot. And let’s focus on the people who are most likely to learn and use what we’re teaching.
- Learning about users over generating deliverables. Although we will generate documentation, the purpose of our work is teaching people to learn about their system’s users, not generate documentations.
- Working in quick iterations, even on research and design. Although we won’t be building software, we’ll take our cue from agile development and continue to do our work in iterations or “sprints.” Each sprint should deliver value and build upon the previous sprint.

## Approach

### 1. Start the transformation with "discovery," or module 0, that determines module sequence.
Before we begin the modules, I'd like to do a mini "discovery" exercise. The focus of this discovery isn't a product, but the group itself. What's motivating them? What's challenging to them? How can human-centered design work for them?

This period includes three pieces:

#### NRM leadership presentation
Colin briefs the NRM leadership on the tenants of human-centered design, and what the jumpstart team members require.

#### One-on-ones with each participant
Colin conducts brief phone interviews with each team member focusing on their current role, their projects, their personal hopes and fears for the jumpstart effort.

#### In-person intensive
We gather at a Forest Service location for a two day "intensive" focusing on:
- Getting to know the team
  - Reflecting on current NRM opportunities and challenges (and how they related to HCD)
  - Review of the team member projects, their current vision and success metrics
- Introducing human-centered design
  - Introduction to the basic tenants of human-centered design
  - How human-centered design builds on other project management approaches
  - How this effort relates to Forest Service executive priorities
- Group norming
  - What we expect from participants
  - What they can expect from us
  - Onboarding to project tools

### 2. Split the project into approximately month-long *modules* for four best practices.

We'll focus a module on each of the following best practices:

#### A. Before product development begins, the team conducts *contextual inquiry* into the needs of the people who will use the system.
Contextual inquiry is a combination of interviews and observation. We'll focus on using it to shape the initial stages of a product's life cycle.

#### B. While the product is in development, the team repeatedly conducts *usability testing* with the product's end users.
Usability testing is asking the people who will actually use the product to complete tasks with an in-development product, while other people observe. We'll focus on how usability testing can hone the implementation of a product's ideas and surface new problems.

#### C. Product development teams map end users' full *journey* achieving a goal, including but not limited to, interacting with their product.
Journey mapping involves creating a sequential diagram of the systems, people and tasks users complete to achieve a goal. Journey maps originate at the beginnig of a project, but can be updated to reflect ongoing project progress and impacts.

#### D. Products support a vision that's articulated in terms of solving user needs and measurable business goals.
Vision-setting isn't a distinct method, but a goal supported by several other common human-centered design tools like the KJ-method, product boxing and metrics definition. We'll focus on how a strong vision at the right level of granularity can successfully guide a project without making erroneous assumptions about what users need.

#### Module components

We'll dedicate a module of the project to each best practice and spend about a month per module. Each module will include:

##### Learning

Colin will convene a webinar that includes both covers the philosophy and mechanics of each best practice. Each webinar will be 2-3 hours and include project-specific exercises, opportunities for discussion, etc.

##### Applying
Each webinar will end with an assignment--an opportunity for participants to practice this technique on their project. The parameters will be broad and widely applicable to many project stages. Colin hopes people can practice what they're learning in realistic situations and in ways that benefit their projects.

##### Coaching and listening
Once or twice during each module, Colin will meet with each participant to check in on how their application is going and help unblock challenges. These sessions are also an opportunity for Colin to hear what's hard about applying these approaches to NRM projects.

##### Reflection
At the end of each module, the group will meet to conduct a "retro" on what people learned, what was hard and what we could improve in the design of future modules.


### 5. Conclude with an in-person retreat focused on developing a roadmap for human-centered design within the Forest Service.
At the end of the modules, we'll convene another in-person session to create next steps for NRM's journey to human-centered design.
